## Data Overview
[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)


Built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing 6 activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.


This project was completed using only the files below.  The raw signal data files were ignored.

**features.txt:** IDs and Names of the 561 features.

**activity_labels.txt:** IDs and Names for each of the 6 activities.

**X_train.txt:** 7352 observations with 561 variables representing each feature for 21 of the 30 volunteers.

**subject_train.txt:** 7352 observations denoting the IDs of the volunteers related to each of the observations in X_train.txt.

**y_train.txt:** 7352 observations denoting the IDs of the activities related to each of the observations in X_train.txt.

**X_test.txt:** 2947 observations with 561 variables representing each feature for 9 of the 30 volunteers.

**subject_test.txt:** 2947 observations denoting the IDs of the volunteers related to each of the observations in X_test.txt.

**y_test.txt:** 2947 observations denoting the IDs of the activities related to each of the observations in X_test.txt.


## Transformations and Work Performed
1. Read in the training and test data sets.  Merge to create one data set.
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. The tidy data set was output to a delimited TXT file.
